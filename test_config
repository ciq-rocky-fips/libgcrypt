# Show expected failures as the tests run if 1. These come from the traces to the log.
# This is the default. When the test passes, you will see something like:
# ```
# starting test run_digest_selftests, fail run_digest_selftests.fail
# verifying run_digest_selftests, trace run_digest_selftests
# Expected Failures:
# GCRYPT: fips.c:526 0: run_digest_selftests SHA KATs MD (SHA-1) FAILED
# GCRYPT: fips.c:526 1: run_digest_selftests SHA KATs MD (SHA-224) FAILED
# GCRYPT: fips.c:526 2: run_digest_selftests SHA KATs MD (SHA-384) FAILED
# GCRYPT: fips.c:526 3: run_digest_selftests SHA KATs MD (SHA-512) FAILED
# PASS verified run_digest_selftests run_digest_selftests
# ```
# The above means that expected failure cases failed and the tests pass.
# Once the verification is to be trusted, set `SHOW_EXPECTED_FAILURES=1` here.
#
# Also see README.md
SHOW_EXPECTED_FAILURES=1

# With `SHOW_EXPECTED_FAILURES=0` output is more terse. Example:
#```
#starting test run_digest_selftests, fail run_digest_selftests.fail
#verifying run_digest_selftests, trace run_digest_selftests
#PASS verified run_digest_selftests run_digest_selftests
#```
